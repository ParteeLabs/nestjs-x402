```

## Usage

> Placeholder: Detailed usage instructions will be added here.

## Motivation

1. The x402 payment processing system is a powerful and flexible solution for handling payments in agent-based applications.
2. NestJS is a production-ready framework for backend development but lacks built-in support for x402.
3. Existing x402 support is limited to Express.js, leaving a gap for NestJS developers.
4. This library bridges that gap by providing decorators and utilities to integrate x402 seamlessly into NestJS applications.
